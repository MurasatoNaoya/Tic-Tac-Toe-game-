# Tic-Tac-Toe game 
This simple Tic-Tac-Toe project was a project that introduced me the idea of creasating self-defined fucntions in Python, along with the understanding of how such functions could be used together to fulfill a certain purpose. 

This project was initally started and eventually completed on a seperate text editor over the course of one week. This explaining the low number of commits to the repository.
